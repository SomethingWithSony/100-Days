# 100-Day Game Development Challenge: Crafting a Unique Survival Simulator

## Objective
I’m embarking on a 100-day challenge to create a polished game from start to finish. Over the years, I’ve started many small projects but struggled to complete them. This challenge is my commitment to improving my skills, staying disciplined, and finally shipping a game I’m proud of.

## Game Concept
The game is a unique blend of my favorite games, combining the best elements of:
- **Prison Architect** (art style and base-building mechanics)
- **RimWorld** (complex NPC interactions and colony management)
- **Project Zomboid** (survival mechanics and post-apocalyptic setting)
- **Stardew Valley** (charming world-building and progression)

### Key Features:
- **Survival Mechanics**: Scavenge for resources, fend off threats, and manage your colony’s needs.
- **Base Building**: Design and expand your base with a Prison Architect-inspired art style.
- **NPC Interactions**: Recruit and manage survivors with unique personalities and skills, inspired by RimWorld.
- **Progression System**: Grow your colony from a small outpost to a thriving community, with Stardew Valley-like progression.
- **Dynamic World**: A post-apocalyptic setting where every decision matters, inspired by Project Zomboid.

- ## The 100-Day Challenge
I’ve often struggled to finish projects, so I’m using this challenge to:
- Build discipline and consistency in my development process.
- Learn new skills and refine existing ones.
- Create a polished, playable game from start to finish.
- Share my progress publicly to stay accountable.

## Roadmap
### Phase 1: Planning and Prototyping (Days 1–20)
- Define core mechanics and gameplay loop.
- Create a basic prototype with placeholder assets.
- Set up version control and project management tools.

### Phase 2: Core Development (Days 21–70)
- Implement survival mechanics, base building, and NPC interactions.
- Develop the art style and create key assets.
- Playtest and iterate on core features.

### Phase 3: Polishing and Final Touches (Days 71–100)
- Refine gameplay balance and fix bugs.
- Add sound effects, music, and UI polish.
- Prepare for a public release or demo.

## Technology Stack
This project is built using the following tools and technologies:
- **Pygame**: A Python library for creating 2D games. I chose Pygame because of its simplicity, Python integration (Programing language i have the most experience), and suitability for prototyping and small-scale projects.
- **Git/GitHub**: For version control and project management.
- **Aseprite**: For creating pixel art and animations.
- **Audacity**: For editing sound effects and music.
- **Trello**: For task management and tracking progress during the 100-day challenge.
